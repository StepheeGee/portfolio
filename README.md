How long you spent working on this assignment

7 hours. I had the worst luck today. And it's really my own fault. There was a guy that forked this repo, named Sam. I liked his design, so I created a clone of his repository. And it completely, crashed my system. I had to start all the way over. I hate my life right now.....so much.And I'm using my Dad's laptop. Thanks, Sam! And yes, I learned a hard lesson on why we push our work periodically. 

So it may look like I disregarded this assignment, but I didn't. Anyway, I deleted my first portfolio repo and recreated it so that I could clone Davina's original. And I realize that I should've just done that the first time, but I really liked his design.
